PLP for test engineers

Abstract
This document gives you a set of resources that you can study to improve your Python knowledge. It also lists some exercises meant to give you some hands-on practice. The exercises not only test your understanding but should also generate valuable discussions with your mentor. Because of this you should try to get feedback on your progress as often and as early as possible.

Online Resources
The Python Tutorial is the best resource for diving into Python and should be enough to solve the exercises in this document. Another excellent resource for understanding and visualizing your program execution is Python Tutor. 

    Problem 1:
Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included).
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

Hints:
Consider use range(#begin, #end) method

    Problem 2:
Define a class which has at least two methods:
getString: to get a string from console input
printString: to print the string in upper case.

Hints:
Use __init__ method to construct some parameters

    Problem 3:
Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
without,hello,bag,world
Then, the output should be:
bag,hello,without,world

	Problem 4:
Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of letters and digits.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
hello world! 123
Then, the output should be:
LETTERS 10
DIGITS 3

       Problem 5:
Please write a program to generate all sentences where subject is in ["I", "You"] and verb is in ["Play", "Love"] and the object is in ["Hockey","Football"].

Hints:
Use list[index] notation to get a element from a list.

    Problem 6:
Write a program which reads from a text file (text file to be provided) and returns individual words in lowercase and stripped from digits and punctuation. It should return a list of words.

      Problem 6.1
Make a function which takes as input the list of words, and returns a dict that has as a key the word and as value the number of occurrences.
     Problem 6.2
Return the word with the most occurrences
